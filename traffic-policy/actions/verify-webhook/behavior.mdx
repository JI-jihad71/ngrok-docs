### Behavior

The **verify-webhook** action validates that incoming webhook requests are authentic. When a request is received, the action verifies the request by validating its signature against a known secret. If the verification is successful, the action allows the request to continue through the action chain and to finally to your application; if verification fails, the request will be terminated with a `403 Forbidden` response.

#### Verification Process

- **Signature Validation**: The action validates incoming webhook signature to confirm the request originates from the configured provider and that the payload has not been tampered with.
- **Request Handling**: If the webhook verification is successful, the request is forwarded to the next action. If the verification fails, the request chain is terminated with a `403` response.
- **Configurable Enforcement**: By default, verification failures result in termination. However, setting `enforce: false` allows unverified requests to proceed, while logging the verification result. This option is for debugging and testing.

#### Endpoint Verification

Some webhook providers require an initial endpoint verification challenge to validate that your application is legitimate before sending webhook events. The **verify-webhook** action automatically handles endpoint verification challenges for supported providers.

- Supported providers:
  - Twitter
  - Worldline
  - Xero
  - Zoom

#### Replay Prevention with Timestamp Tolerance

To prevent replay attacks, ngrok verifies that the webhookâ€™s timestamp falls within an acceptable range.

#### Secret Handling and Encryption

All secrets used for webhook verification are encrypted at config validation. When ngrok processes a requests the secret is decrypted.
